<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>To comply with EU legislation that was introduced in May 2012, this page documents how this website might collect information as you browse and use it to provide a tailored service to improve your online experience.</p>
<p></p>
<h2>What are cookies?</h2>
<p>Cookies are small files which collect and store small amounts of data as you browse which can be accessed later by our web server or your own computer to provide a more tailored browsing experience.<br />
<br />
A cookie is sometimes created when you load a new webpage and then stored in your browser's cache. This enables this website to use this information to remember your personal settings and preferences when you revisit the website.<br />
<br />
Cookies are often used when you log in to a website or submit a form, allowing us to use that information throughout our service and prevent you from entering the same information on multiple occasions.<br />
<br />
It is possible to disable cookies in your browser, but is likely to result in a less streamlined browsing experience.<br />
<br />
The cookies that are used by this website are listed below, along with an explanation of how and why they are used.</p>

<h2>Cookies we use</h2>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<h2>Google</h2>
<p>Google provide services for web statistics, social media, video content and maps.<br />
<br />
Analytics is a web statistics service that tracks how people find and use websites. The information is anonymous and helps webmasters plan improvements to websites.<br />
<br />
Google also runs a social media service called Google+ and the +1 button requires Google login for full functionality.<br />
<br />
Google's video content is provided by YouTube, which uses the same cookie procedures as the analytics and +1 platforms.<br />
<br />
Other cookies for features such as Google Maps may also be used, which may track your approximate location in order to provide directions and distances to certain locations.<br />
<br />
For more information on Google's services and how they use cookies, please see their privacy policy below:</p>
